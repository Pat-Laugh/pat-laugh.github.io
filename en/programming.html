    Here is a list of some projects I've completed or nearing completion that I
    think might be useful.

    WebSSON is a data format that I am developing that surely will prove useful.
    Here, I group in "WebSSON", the data format language, a parser (in C++) and
    deserializers (in C++). Everything is still in development, but I think it's
    nearly done. Most of the work left now is to write the documentation.
    <br>
    See GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/pat-laugh/websson-libraries">here</a>.

    Documentation for the language is available
    <a href="https://pat-laugh.ca/websson-doc/">here</a>.

    MDSV, for Markdown Separated Values, is a data format that is kind of like
    CSV, except the '|' char is used to separate values. The goal is to be able to
    parse tables within a Markdown file.
    <br>
    This was made to practice making a library in Java and put it in the Maven
    central repository. It does not support deserialization.

    See GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/pat-laugh/mdsv">here</a>.

    Gitignore-modifier allows to add templates of files to ignore in a gitignore
    file (for Git). It allows other things, but the main purpose is to quickly
    create a good gitignore file for any new project.
