    Here is a list of some projects I've undertaken that I

    Gitignore Modifier allows adding templates of files to ignore in a <code>.gitignore</code>
    file (for Git). The main purpose is to quickly and correctly
    create this file for any new project.

    Notes-to-text is an appplication that converts iPhone Notes documents to text.
    It allows users to "AirDrop" a document on their computer and then use its text without opening the Notes app.

    WebSSON is a data language that can represent complex data structures in a
    human-readable format, with less clutter than JSON and XML. The original aim
    was also to build a language called WebSS that'd unify various
    languages' syntax idiosyncracies (and possibly concepts too), but for now
    only the data language is mostly complete.
    A proof-of-concept compiler was in the works.
