    Here is a list of some projects I've completed or nearing completion that I
    think might be useful.

    WebSSON is a data format that I am developing that surely will prove useful.
    A parser and a serializer (in C++) are developed at the same time.
    Everything is still in development, but I think it's
    nearly done. Most of the work left now is to write the documentation.

    MDSV, for Markdown Separated Values, is a data format that is kind of like
    CSV, except the '|' char is used to separate values. The goal is to be able to
    parse tables within a Markdown file.
    <br>
    This was made to practice making a library in Java and putting it in the Maven
    Central Repository. It does not support serialization.

    Gitignore-modifier allows to add templates of files to ignore in a gitignore
    file (for Git). It allows other things, but the main purpose is to quickly
    create a good gitignore file for any new project.
