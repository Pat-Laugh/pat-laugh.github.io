    WebSSON is a data format that I am developing that surely will prove useful.
    A parser and a serializer (in C++) are developed at the same time.
    Everything is still in development. A big part
    of the work left now is to write the documentation.

    Gitignore Modifier allows to add templates of files to ignore in a gitignore
    file (for Git). It allows other things, but the main purpose is to quickly
    create a good gitignore file for any new project.
