    If you wish to call me, I'd appreciate that you <b>first send me an
    email or text message to agree on a time for a call</b>. This will
    ensure that I respond to your call.<br>Otherwise, it will likely end up in
    the voicemail as I tend to not take calls on my personal phone while working.
    Please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as possible.
