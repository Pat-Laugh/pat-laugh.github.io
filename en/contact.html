    If you wish to call me, I'd appreciate that you <b>first send me an
    email or text message to agree on a time for a call</b>. This will
    ensure that I respond to your call.<br>Otherwise, it is likely to end up at
    the voicemail as I tend to not take calls on my personal phone while at
    work. Please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as possible.<br>
    You can check my availability in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQVqp7405aNVq8HP7cGzNEkk2rCfj5DRjV_ikYbujkTr4gDVAq2nUf3sLo-GvUCM8LsW9KG2ZOf-T10/pubhtml">this Google Sheets document</a>.
    Take a time where I'm available that's best for you!
