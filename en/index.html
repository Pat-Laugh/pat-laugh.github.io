    My name is Patrick Laughrea. This is my personal website, where I'll try to
    post information about what I do in my personal time.
    My field of expertise is programming.
    However, in my blog, I'll try to put thoughts about anything. In the contact tab,
    there is information to <a href="contact">contact me</a>.
    I am bilingual; this website is also available in <a href="/fr/">French</a>.

    I believe an important skill for any programmer is
    to be able to understand the logic behind code. While languages may have different
    syntaxes and words, approaches to solve a particular problem will likely
    be very similar using any. If our
    thoughts could be put on paper as languages, surely the result would be similar!

    Currently, I mostly enjoy writing in C++ and Python. I also try to keep up to date with
    new technologies related to full-stack web development, and best practices in general.

    I have interests in many other things, mainly social sciences, such as
    economics, management, politics, psychology, and sociology.
    I'll write about that and more in my blog when thoughts occur and I
    think about putting them here.
