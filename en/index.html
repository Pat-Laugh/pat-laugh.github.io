    My name is Patrick Laughrea. This is my personnal website, where I'll try to
    post information about what I do in my personnal time. As you can infer from
    seeing the top menu, my main interests are related to programming and music.
    However, in my blog, I'll put thoughts about anything. In the contact tab,
    there is information in case you wish to contact me accross different social
    networks. I am bilingual, so this website is available in both English and
    <a href="/fr/">French</a>.

    As for programming, I believe an important skill for a programmer to have is
    to understand the logic behind the code. While languages may have different
    syntax and words, the underlying approach to solving a problem will usually
    be very similar regardless of the language. If such a language as of our
    thoughts could be put on paper, then perhaps it'd actually lead to the same
    result, since everyone can visualize a same solution differently! Currently,
    I mostly enjoy writing in C++, Java, and Python, along with any technology
    and language related to full-stack web development. I'm currently
    developping a data format language called
    <a href="programming#websson">WebSSON</a>. So far, the project is successful
    and the whole development has been a great experience!

    I play music and I compose music. I play electric guitar, electric bass and
    electric piano. I compose for all these instruments, and I can compose for
    drums and voice. I also write lyrics for songs. I think composing music is a
    nice creative activity, kind of like designing and coding a program. It is
    somewhat related, in the sense that the durations of most note are relative
    to each other by powers of 2. For instance, an eighth is twice as long as a
    sixteenth. I nearly entirely learned music by myself. I don't have formal
    training in music theory. It's definitely useful, but I think I can compose
    and play music fine without it!

    I have interests in many other things, including fitness, cooking, and
    social sciences. I'll write about that in my blog when thoughts occur and I
    think about putting them here.
