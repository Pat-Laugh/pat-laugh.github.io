    My name is Patrick Laughrea. This is my personal website, where I'll try to
    post relevant information about myself.
    My field of expertise is programming.
    In the contact tab,
    there is information to <a href="contact">contact me</a>.
    I am bilingual; this website is also available in <a href="/fr/">French</a>.

    For professional information, you can check my
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pat-laugh">LinkedIn profile</a>.
    I'm currently looking for paid work.

    I believe an important skill for any programmer is
    to be able to understand the intent behind code. While languages may have different
    syntaxes and words, approaches to solve a particular problem will likely
    be very similar using any. If our
    thoughts could be put on paper as languages, surely the result would be similar!
