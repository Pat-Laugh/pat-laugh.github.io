    My name is Patrick Laughrea. This is my personal website, where I'll try to
    post information about what I do in my personal time.
    My field of expertise is programming.
    In the contact tab,
    there is information to <a href="contact">contact me</a>.
    I am bilingual; this website is also available in <a href="/fr/">French</a>.

    I believe an important skill for any programmer is
    to be able to understand the logic behind code. While languages may have different
    syntaxes and words, approaches to solve a particular problem will likely
    be very similar using any. If our
    thoughts could be put on paper as languages, surely the result would be similar!
