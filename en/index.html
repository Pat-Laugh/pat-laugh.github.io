    My name is Patrick Laughrea. I was born in Montreal in 1991. This is my personnal website where
    I'll try to post stuff about what I do with my personnal time. As you can see from the top menu,
    my main interests are related to programming and music, but in my "blog", I'll put other stuff
    that spark my mind. In the contact tab is all useful information in case you wish to get in
    contact with me accross different social networks. By the way, I am bilingual: I speak both
    English and French fluently.

    I'll now write about programming. I can write in a variety of languages. I believe the important
    skill for a programmer is to understand the logic behind the code. While languages may have
    different syntax and words, the underlying approach to solving a problem will usually very
    similar regardless of the language. If such a language as of our thoughts could be put on paper,
    then perhaps it'd actually lead to the same result, since everyone can visualize a same solution
    differently! Currently, I mostly enjoy writing in C++, Java, and Python, along with any technology
    and language related to full-stack web development. I have an interest in anything complex. I'm
    currently developping a data format language called <a href="programming#websson">WebSSON</a>.
    So far, the project is successful and the whole development up to now has been a great experience!

    I play music and I compose music. I play electric guitar, electric bass and electric piano.
    I compose for all these instruments, and I can compose for drums and voice. I also write lyrics for
    songs. I think composing music is a nice creative activity, just like writing or designing and
    coding a program. It is somewhat related, in the sense that most times of notes are relative to
    each other by powers of 2. For instance, an eight is twice as long as a sixteenth. I nearly
    entirely learned music by myself. I don't have formal training in music theory. It's probably
    useful, but I think I can compose and play music fine without it!

    I have interest in many other things, including fitness, cooking, social sciences. I'll write
    about that in my blog when thoughts occur and I think about putting them here.
