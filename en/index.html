    My name is Patrick Laughrea. This is my personal website, where I'll try to
    post information about what I do in my personal time. As you can infer from
    the top menu, my main interests are related to programming and music.
    However, in my blog, I'll try to put thoughts about anything. In the contact tab,
    there is information to <a href="contact">contact me</a>.
    I am bilingual; this website is also available in <a href="/fr/">French</a>.

    I believe an important skill for any programmer is
    to be able to understand the logic behind code. While languages may have different
    syntaxes and words, approaches to solve a particular problem will likely
    be very similar using any. If our
    thoughts could be put on paper as languages, surely the result would be similar!
    <br>
    Currently, I mostly enjoy writing in C++ and Python. I also try to keep up to date with
    new technologies related to full-stack web development, and best practices in general.

    I play music and I compose music. I play electric guitar, electric bass and
    electric piano. I compose for all these instruments, and I can compose for
    drums and voice. I also write lyrics for songs. I think composing music is a
    nice creative activity, kind of like designing and coding a program.
    <br>
    I nearly entirely learned music by myself. I don't have formal
    training in music theory. It's probably useful, but I think I can compose
    and play music fine without it!

    I have interests in many other things, mainly social sciences, such as
    economics, management, politics, psychology, and sociology.
    I'll write about that and more in my blog when thoughts occur and I
    think about putting them here.
