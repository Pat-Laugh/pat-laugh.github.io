    My name is Patrick Laughrea. This is my personal website, where I'll try to
    post information about what I do in my personal time. As you can infer from
    the top menu, my main interests are related to programming and music.
    However, in my blog, I'll put thoughts about anything. In the contact tab,
    there is information in case you wish to <a href="contact">contact me</a> accross different social
    networks. I am bilingual, so this website is available in both English and
    <a href="/fr/">French</a>.

    For professional information about me, you can check my
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pat-laugh">LinkedIn profile</a>.

    I am currently working full time in the field of software development.

    I believe an important skill for any programmer is
    being able to understand the logic behind code. While languages may have different
    syntax and words, the approach in order to solve a problem will likely
    be very similar using any. If a language such as of our
    thoughts could be put on paper, then surely the result would be similar,
    since everyone can visualize the same solution differently!
    <br>
    Currently, I mostly enjoy writing in C++ and Python. I try to keep up to date with
    new technologies related to full-stack web development and best practices in general.
    <br>
    A long-term project I've been working on is developing a data format language called
    <a href="programming#websson">WebSSON</a>. So far, the project has been successful
    and the whole development has been a great experience!

    I play music and I compose music. I play electric guitar, electric bass and
    electric piano. I compose for all these instruments, and I can compose for
    drums and voice. I also write lyrics for songs. I think composing music is a
    nice creative activity, kind of like designing and coding a program.
    <br>
    I nearly entirely learned music by myself. I don't have formal
    training in music theory. It's probably useful, but I think I can compose
    and play music fine without it!

    I have interests in many other things, mainly in social sciences, such as
    economics, management, politics, psychology, and sociology.
    I'll write about that and more in my blog when thoughts occur and I
    think about putting them here.
