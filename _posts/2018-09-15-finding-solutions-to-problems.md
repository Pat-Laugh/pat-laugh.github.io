title: Finding solutions to problems

I believe the best way to find a solution to a problem is to understand the
problem and its environment thoroughly. You then have to find a solution to that
and understand why it'll work. Not understanding a solution and mindlessly going
ahead with its implementation is akin to leaving a resolution to chance.

Maybe you don't have the time to fully understand a problem. That's fine, but
then you have to accept that your vision of the problem is your own
approximation and that your solution would only address that approximation.

What's for sure is that you first have to acknowledge the problem actually
exists... I've seen some people claiming to be "optimist" or "positive",
but in actuality ignoring a problem. It won't solve it! It's just lying to
oneself. But worse than that, and devious, is pretending not only that it does
not exist, but that the issues that its existence might be causing also do not
exist. In other words, pretending that all is going well when it's not.

I must say, I hate having to blindly follow instructions, especially when I
realize they're full of useless actions. Some guy, somewhere, decided that I'll
have to follow some steps to accomplish a goal, and they didn't even take the
time to understand what all the actions they ask me to undertake are for and if
they're useful.

Easy problems are boring and tough problems shouldn't be easy. They should not
be tackled with laziness; that is, trying "solutions" with the hope they'll
work. The effort should be put in and that should be embraced. I don't get much
satisfaction playing dice and winning; I didn't win, the dice won for me...
But some people think differently: They'll take credit when luck did the work
for them and they'll blame luck when it did not. I prefer, and try, to own my
own luck and bear responsibility. I would not be able to consciously accept
credit for solving a problem I didn't actually understand the solution for.
